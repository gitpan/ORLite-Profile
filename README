NAME
    ORLite::Profile - Experimental Aspect-Oriented Profiler for ORLite

SYNOPSIS
      # Load your ORLite database
      use My::ORLiteDB;
      
  # Load the profiler
      use ORLite::Profile;
      
  # Stimulate the load you want to profile here.
      # When the program exists, the profiling data
      # will ne printed to STDERR.

DESCRIPTION
    ORLite::Profile is an experimental profiler for ORLite. It currently
    serves as an experimental test-bed for more wide-scoped DBI profiling
    and monitoring modules.

    It weaves Aspect-based profiling logic into the DBI layer, below the
    ORLite logic itself.

    At the present time, the main purpose of this module is to examine the
    aggregate total time spent in the connect, prepare, and execute tasks.

    I hope to expand this in the future to capture more interesting types of
    data.

Using This Module
    This module has no interface and takes no options.

    You just load it after your ORLite-based class is loaded, and then
    generate some test load.

    When the program exits, the profing information is written to STDERR.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
